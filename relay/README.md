> **Note: STM32 Nucleo Board with F401xx microcontroller is used for interfacing. The programming is completely baremetal without the use of CubeMX software.** 

## Requirements

### Hardware

- STM32 F401xx based Nucleo Development Board
- Relay
- LED
- Resistor 220Î©

### Software

- STM32 Cube IDE

### Additional Code

- The `printf()` function cannot be executed by default. 
- Some additional code is added in "**Src\syscalls.c**" file which makes use of the SWO trace pin to print statements.
